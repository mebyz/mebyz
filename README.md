I'm a self-taught senior developer, i've been working years in the digital media (news) & education (training) industries,
along with many other things i did and continue to do on the side, like growing my tropical garden here in reunion island (France),
grooming my pets (cat and dog), listening to all kind of music, travelling around the world, cooking and ... brewing beers :)
